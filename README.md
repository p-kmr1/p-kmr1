### 🚀 About Me 
  
  🎓 I am Parth Kumar, a student dev lover primarily interesetd in web, mobile and software development. 
   I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. 
   In 2020, I learnt Django, React, Node.js and Electron. In 2021 till now, I learnt Next.js, SASS, Progressive Web App (PWA) and some Three.js. I also got started with blogging recently. 
   
   🪄 Outside the realm of tech as well, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from guitar, close-up magic, sketching, touch typing and more. 
   
   📚 I adore reading books on personal development & financial literacy; with the occasional fiction novel as well. My favourite titles are Keep Going, Steal Like an Artist and Show Your Work from Austin Kleon in the genre of personal development. When it comes to the genre of financial literacy, I have to pick Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and Brandon Sanderson's books in fictional genres such as the Mistborn series. 
   
   🌍 I relish in travelling as well, even though it is not something that I do very often.
